## Save and Commit changes locally to git


- **Save** the changes to your parameters file.

- **Stage your file, write a commit message and commit.**


{{% notice warning %}}

Please **ONLY STAGE YOUR NEW PARAMETER FILE** (ie if for any reason you've accidentally edited any other file in the repo, please do not stage it).

{{% /notice %}}

The changes have now been committed locally to git but we still need to update our remote forks on GitHub. We'll do this by pushing our local changes to GitHub.
